This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","user":{"id":"S-1-5-21-1918032094-2382968797-800248713-1000","name":"breach","domain":"CLIENT1"},"host":{"id":"19fc45ac-5890-4f96-81b1-50ed111c0ce4","name":"CLIENT1","hostname":"CLIENT1","architecture":"x86","os":{"build":"7601.0","platform":"windows","version":"6.1","family":"windows","name":"Windows 7 Professional","kernel":"6.1.7601.18741 (win7sp1_gdr.150202-1526)"}},"agent":{"id":"0b755aca-0a9a-454a-9800-1979901962a0","version":"7.2.0","type":"winlogbeat","ephemeral_id":"de845cd9-5141-4c92-ad32-27a4518307e9","hostname":"CLIENT1"},"source":{"ip":"127.0.0.1","port":0,"domain":"CLIENT1"},"winlog":{"record_id":4661,"task":"Logon","channel":"Security","provider_name":"Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing","api":"wineventlog","opcode":"Info","provider_guid":"{54849625-5478-4994-A5BA-3E3B0328C30D}","event_data":{"LogonProcessName":"User32 ","LmPackageName":"-","SubjectUserSid":"S-1-5-18","TransmittedServices":"-","LogonType":"2","TargetLogonId":"0x1f189","AuthenticationPackageName":"Negotiate","LogonGuid":"{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}","SubjectDomainName":"WORKGROUP","SubjectLogonId":"0x3e7","SubjectUserName":"CLIENT1$","KeyLength":"0"},"computer_name":"CLIENT1","keywords":["Audit Success"],"process":{"pid":448,"thread":{"id":496}},"event_id":4624},"event":{"type":"authentication_success","kind":"event","code":4624,"action":"Logon","created":"2019-08-02T09:55:12.183Z","category":"authentication"},"log":{"level":"information"},"process":{"pid":380,"executable":"C:\\Windows\\System32\\winlogon.exe","name":"winlogon.exe"}}

This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","winlog":{"api":"wineventlog","provider_guid":"{54849625-5478-4994-A5BA-3E3B0328C30D}","provider_name":"Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing","computer_name":"CLIENT1","process":{"pid":448,"thread":{"id":512}},"task":"Logon","opcode":"Info","channel":"Security","event_id":4624,"event_data":{"IpPort":"-","LogonType":"3","LmPackageName":"NTLM V1","SubjectUserSid":"S-1-0-0","IpAddress":"-","SubjectUserName":"-","KeyLength":"0","AuthenticationPackageName":"NTLM","TransmittedServices":"-","TargetLogonId":"0x1551b","LogonGuid":"{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}","SubjectLogonId":"0x0","SubjectDomainName":"-","LogonProcessName":"NtLmSsp "},"record_id":4691,"keywords":["Audit Success"]}}
