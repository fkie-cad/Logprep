## Introduction

Logprep allows to collect, process and forward log messages from various data sources.
Log messages are being read and written by so-called connectors.
Currently, connectors for Kafka, Opensearch, Opensearch and JSON(L) files exist.
Additionally, an Input Connector for HTTP Input is provided, which starts an uvicorn server and
accepts log message via POST Requests.

The log messages are processed step-by-step by a pipeline of processors,
where each processor modifies an event that is being passed through.
The main idea is that each processor performs a simple task that is easy to carry out.
Once the log massage is passed through all processors in the pipeline the resulting
message is sent to a configured output connector.

Logprep is designed to be expandable with new connectors and processors.

Logprep is primarily designed to process log messages. Generally, Logprep can handle JSON messages,
allowing further applications besides log handling.

## About Logprep

### Pipelines

Logprep processes incoming log messages with a configured pipeline that can be spawned
multiple times via multiprocessing.
The following chart shows a basic setup that represents this behaviour.
The pipeline consists of three processors: the `Dissector`, `Geo-IP Enricher` and the 
`Dropper`. 
Each pipeline runs concurrently and takes one event from it's `Input Connector`.
Once the log messages is fully processed the result will be forwarded to the `Output Connector`,
after which the pipeline will take the next message, repeating the processing cycle.

I --> J[Dropper] 
end
F --> K1[Output\nConnector]
H --> K2[Output\nConnector]
J --> K3[Output\nConnector]
```

### Processors

Every processor has one simple task to fulfill.
For example, the `Dissector` can split up long message fields into multiple subfields
to facilitate structural normalization.
The `Geo-IP Enricher`, for example, takes an ip-address and adds the geolocation of it to the 
log message, based on a configured geo-ip database. 
Or the `Dropper` deletes fields from the log message.

As detailed overview of all processors can be found in the
[processor documentation](https://logprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual/configuration/processor.html).

To influence the behaviour of those processors, each can be configured with a set of rules.
These rules define two things.
Firstly, they specify when the processor should process a log message
and secondly they specify how to process the message. 
For example which fields should be deleted or to which IP-address the geolocation should be 
retrieved.

For performance reasons on startup all rules per processor are aggregated to a generic and a specific rule tree, respectively. 
Instead of evaluating all rules independently for each log message the message is checked against 
the rule tree.
Each node in the rule tree represents a condition that has to be meet,
while the leafs represent changes that the processor should apply.
If no condition is met, the processor will just pass the log event to the next processor.

The following chart gives an example of such a rule tree:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[root]
A-->B[Condition 1]
A-->C[Condition 2]
A-->D[Condition 3]
B-->E[Condition 4]
B-->H(Rule 1)
C-->I(Rule 2)
D-->J(rule 3)
E-->G(Rule 4)
```

To further improve the performance, it is possible to prioritize specific nodes of the rule tree,
such that broader conditions are higher up in the tree. 
And specific conditions can be moved further down.
Following json gives an example of such a rule tree configuration. 
This configuration will lead to the prioritization of `tags` and `message` in the rule tree.

```json
{
  "priority_dict": {
    "category": "01",
    "message": "02"
  },
  "tag_map": {
    "check_field_name": "check-tag"
  }
}
```

Instead of writing very specific rules that apply to single log messages, it is also possible
to define generic rules that apply to multiple messages. 
It is possible to define a set of generic and specific rules for each processor, resulting 
in two rule trees. 

### Connectors

Connectors are responsible for reading the input and writing the result to a desired output. 
The main connectors that are currently used and implemented are a kafka-input-connector and a
kafka-output-connector allowing to receive messages from a kafka-topic and write messages into a
kafka-topic. Addionally, you can use the Opensearch or Opensearch output connectors to ship the
messages directly to Opensearch or Opensearch after processing.

The details regarding the connectors can be found in the
[input connector documentation](https://logprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual/configuration/input.html)
and
[output connector documentation](https://logprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual/configuration/output.html).

### Configuration

To run Logprep, certain configurations have to be provided. Because Logprep is designed to run in a
containerized environment like Kubernetes, these configurations can be provided via the filesystem or
http. By providing the configuration via http, it is possible to control the configuration change via
a flexible http api. This enables Logprep to quickly adapt to changes in your environment.

First, a general configuration is given that describes the pipeline and the connectors, 
and lastly, the processors need rules in order to process messages correctly.

The following yaml configuration shows an example configuration for the pipeline shown 
in the graph above:

```yaml
process_count: 3
timeout: 0.1

pipeline:
  - dissector:
      type: dissector
      specific_rules:
        - https://your-api/dissector/
      generic_rules:
        - rules/01_dissector/generic/
  - geoip_enricher:
      type: geoip_enricher
      specific_rules:
        - https://your-api/geoip/
      generic_rules:
        - rules/02_geoip_enricher/generic/
      tree_config: artifacts/tree_config.json
      db_path: artifacts/GeoDB.mmdb
  - dropper:
      type: dropper
      specific_rules:
        - rules/03_dropper/specific/
      generic_rules:
        - rules/03_dropper/generic/
              
input:
  mykafka:
    type: confluentkafka_input
    bootstrapservers: [127.0.0.1:9092]
    topic: consumer
    group: cgroup
    auto_commit: true
    session_timeout: 6000
    offset_reset_policy: smallest
output:
  opensearch:
    type: opensearch_output
    hosts:
        - 127.0.0.1:9200
    default_index: default_index
    error_index: error_index
    message_backlog_size: 10000
    timeout: 10000
    max_retries:
    user: the username
    secret: the passord
    cert: /path/to/cert.crt
```

The following yaml represents a dropper rule which according to the previous configuration 
should be in the `rules/03_dropper/generic/` directory.

```yaml
filter: "message"
drop:
  - message
description: "Drops the message field"
```

The condition of this rule would check if the field `message` exists in the log.
If it does exist then the dropper would delete this field from the log message.

Details about the rule language and how to write rules for the processors can be found in the
[rule configuration documentation](https://logprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual/configuration/rules.html).

## Getting Started

### Installation

Python should be present on the system, currently supported are the versions 3.9 - 3.11.

To install Logprep you have following options:

**1. Option:** Installation via PyPI: 

This option is recommended if you just want to use the latest release of logprep.
```
pip install logprep
```

**2. Option:** Installation via Git Repository:

This option is recommended if you are interested in the latest developments and might want to 
contribute to them.
```
git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/Logprep.git
cd Logprep
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Option:** Installation via Github Release

This option is recommended if you just want to try out the latest developments.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/fkie-cad/Logprep.git@latest
```

**4. Option:** Docker build from current commit

This option can be used to build a container image from a specific commit
```
docker build -t logprep .
docker run logprep --help
```

### Testing

Tox can be used to perform unit and acceptance tests (install tox via `pip3 install tox`).
Tests are started by executing `tox` in the project root directory.
This creates a virtual test environment and executes tests within it.

Multiple different test environments were defined for tox.
Those can be executed via: `tox -e [name of the test environment]`.
For Example:

```
tox -e py39-all
```

This runs all tests, calculates the test coverage and evaluates the code quality for the python 
3.9 version.

Multiple environments can be tested within one call: 

```
tox -e py39-all -e py310-all -e py311-all
```

If you want to run them in parallel attach the option `-p`.
This can lead to side effects in I/O operations though, like concurrences in writing or reading
files.
 
An overview of the test environments can be obtained by executing:

```
tox -av
```

In case the requirements change, the test environments must be rebuilt with the parameter `-r`:

```
tox -e py39 -e py310 -e py311 -r
```

### Semgrep

If you want to run semgrep rules run

```
pip install semgrep
```

Afterwards you can just call the tox environment with for example 

```
tox -e py39-semgrep
```

### Running Logprep

Depending on how you have installed Logprep you have different choices to run Logprep as well.  
If you have installed it via PyPI or the Github Development release just run:

```
logprep $CONFIG
```

If you have installed Logprep via cloning the repository then you should run it via:

```
PYTHONPATH="." python3 logprep/run_logprep.py $CONFIG
```

Where `$CONFIG` is the path or uri to a configuration file (see the documentation about the 
[configuration](https://logprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual/configuration/index.html)).
The next sections all assume an installation via pip

### Verifying Configuration

The following command can be executed to verify the configuration file without having to run Logprep:

```
logprep --verify-config $CONFIG
```

Where `$CONFIG` is the path or uri to a configuration file (see the documentation about the 
[configuration](https://logprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual/configuration/index.html)).

### Validating Labeling-Schema and Rules

The following command can be executed to validate the schema and the rules:

```
logprep --validate-rules $CONFIG
```

Where `$CONFIG` is the path or uri to a configuration file (see the documentation about the 
[configuration](https://logprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual/configuration/index.html)).

Alternatively, the validation can be performed directly. Assuming you have cloned the repository 
from git. 

```
PYTHONPATH="." python3 logprep/util/schema_and_rule_checker.py --labeling-schema $LABELING_SCHEMA --labeling-rules $LABELING_RULES
```

Where `$LABELING_SCHEMA` is the path to a labeling-schema (JSON file) and `$LABELING_RULES` is 
the path to a directory with rule files (JSON/YML files, see Rules.md, subdirectories 
are permitted)

Analogously, `--normalization-rules` and `--pseudonymizer-rules` can be used.

Validation does also perform a verification of the pipeline section of the Logprep configuration.

### Reload the Configuration

To change the configuration of Logprep it is not needed to restart Logprep entirely.
Instead, it can be issued to reload the configuration. 
For this, the signal `SIGUSR1` must be send to the Logprep process.

Additionally, a `config_refresh_interval` can be set to periodically and automatically refresh the given configuration.
This can be useful in case of containerized environments (such as Kubernetes), when pod volumes often change
on the fly.

If the configuration does not pass a consistency check, then an error message is logged and 
Logprep keeps running with the previous configuration.
The configuration should be then checked and corrected on the basis of the error message.

## Logprep Quickstart Environment

To demonstrate the functionality of logprep this repo comes with a complete `kafka`, `lokgprep` and
`opensearch` stack. 
To get it running `docker` and `docker-compose` (version >= 1.28) must be first installed.
The docker-compose file is located in the directory `quickstart`.
A prerequisite is to run `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`, otherwise Opensearch might not
properly start.

The environment can either be started with a Logprep container or without one:

### Run without Logprep Container (default)

  1. Run from within the `quickstart` directory: 
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
     It starts and connects `Kafka`, `logprep`, `Opensearch` and `Opensearch Dashboards`.
  2. Run Logprep against loaded environment from main `Logprep` directory:
     ```bash
     logprep quickstart/exampledata/config/pipeline.yml
     ```

### Run with Logprep Container

  * Run from within the `quickstart` directory: 
    ```bash
    docker-compose --profile logprep up -d
    ```

### Interacting with the Quickstart Environment

The start up takes a few seconds to complete, but once everything is up
and running it is possible to write JSON events into Kafka and read the processed events in
Opensearch Dashboards. Following services are available after start up:

| Service | Location |
|:----------|:----|
| Kafka: | `localhost:9092` |
| Logprep metrics: | `localhost:8000` |
| Opensearch: | `localhost:9200` |
| Opensearch Dashboards: | `localhost:5601` |
| Grafana Dashboards: | `localhost:3000` |
| Prometheus: | `localhost:9090` |

The credentials for Grafana are `admin` and `admin`.

The example rules that are used in the docker instance of Logprep can be found 
in `quickstart/exampledata/rules`.
Example events that trigger for the example rules can be found in 
`quickstart/exampledata/input_logdata/test_input.jsonl`.
These events can be added to Kafka with the following command:

```bash
(docker exec -i kafka kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic consumer) < exampledata/input_logdata/test_input.jsonl
```

Once the events have been processed for the first time, the new indices *processed*, *sre* 
and *pseudonyms* should be available in Opensearch Dashboards.

The environment can be stopped via `docker-compose down`.

## Documentation

The documentation for Logprep is online at https://logprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ or it can 
be built locally via tox (install via `pip3 install tox`). 
Building the documentation is done by executing the following command from within 
the project root directory:

```
tox -e py39-docs
```

A HTML documentation can be then found in `doc/_build/html/index.html`.
