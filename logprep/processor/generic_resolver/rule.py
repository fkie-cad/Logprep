Rule Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The generic resolver requires the additional field :code:`generic_resolver`.
Configurable fields are being checked by regex patterns and a configurable value will be added
if a pattern matches.
The parameters within :code:`generic_resolver` must be of the form
:code:`field_mapping: {SOURCE_FIELD: DESTINATION_FIELD},
resolve_list: {REGEX_PATTERN_0: ADDED_VALUE_0, ..., REGEX_PATTERN_N: ADDED_VALUE_N}`.
SOURCE_FIELD will be checked by the regex patterns REGEX_PATTERN_[0-N] and
a new field DESTINATION_FIELD with the value ADDED_VALUE_[0-N] will be added if there is a match.
Adding the option :code:`"append_to_list": True` makes the generic resolver write resolved values
into a list so that multiple different values can be written into the same field.

In the following example :code:`to_resolve` will be checked by the regex pattern :code:`.*Hello.*`.
:code:`"resolved": "Greeting"` will be added to the event if the pattern matches
the value in :code:`to_resolve`.

..  code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:
    :caption: Example

    filter: to_resolve
    generic_resolver:
      field_mapping:
        to_resolve: resolved
      resolve_list:
        .*Hello.*: Greeting

Alternatively, a YML file with a resolve list and a regex pattern can be used to resolve values.
For this, a field :code:`resolve_from_file` with the subfields :code:`path` and :code:`pattern`
must be added.
The resolve list in the file at :code:`path` is then used in conjunction with the regex pattern
in :code:`pattern`.
:code:`pattern` must be a regex pattern with a capture group that is named :code:`mapping`.
The resolver will check for the pattern and get value captured by the :code:`mapping` group.
This captured value is then used in the list from the file.

:code:`ignore_case` can be set to ignore the case when matching values that will be resolved.
It is disabled by default. In the following example :code:`to_resolve: heLLo` would be resolved,
since :code:`ignore_case` is set to true.

..  code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:
    :caption: Example

    filter: to_resolve
    generic_resolver:
      field_mapping:
        to_resolve: resolved
      resolve_list:
        .*Hello.*: Greeting
      ignore_case: true

It is furthermore possible to resolve into dictionaries. In the following example
:code:`{"to_resolve": "Hello!"}` would be resolved to :code:`{"resolved": {"Greeting": "Hello"}}`.

..  code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:
    :caption: Example

    filter: to_resolve
    generic_resolver:
      field_mapping:
        to_resolve: resolved
      resolve_list:
        .*Hello.*: {"Greeting": "Hello"}

Resolved dictionaries can be merged into existing dictionaries. In the following example
:code:`{"to": {"resolve": "Hello!"}}` would be resolved to
:code:`{"to": {"Greeting": "Hello", "resolve": "Hello!"}}`.

..  code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:
    :caption: Example

    filter: to_resolve
    generic_resolver:
      field_mapping:
        to.resolve: to
      resolve_list:
        .*Hello.*: {"Greeting": "Hello"}

In the following example :code:`to_resolve` will be checked by the
regex pattern :code:`\d*(?P<mapping>[a-z]+)\d*` and the list in :code:`path/to/resolve_mapping.yml`
will be used to add new fields.
:code:`"resolved": "resolved foo"` will be added to the event if the value
in :code:`to_resolve` begins with number, ends with numbers and contains foo.
Furthermore, :code:`"resolved": "resolved bar"` will be added to the event
if the value in :code:`to_resolve` begins with number, ends with numbers and contains bar.

    filter: to_resolve
    generic_resolver:
      field_mapping:
        to_resolve: resolved
      resolve_from_file:
        path: path/to/resolve_mapping.yml
        pattern: \d*(?P<mapping>[a-z]+)\d*
