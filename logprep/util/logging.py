class LogprepFormatter(logging.Formatter):
    """
    A custom formatter for logprep logging with additional attributes.

    The Formatter can be initialized with a format string which makes use of
    knowledge of the LogRecord attributes - e.g. the default value mentioned
    above makes use of the fact that the user's message and arguments are pre-
    formatted into a LogRecord's message attribute. Currently, the useful
    attributes in a LogRecord are described by:

    %(name)s            Name of the logger (logging channel)
    %(levelno)s         Numeric logging level for the message (DEBUG, INFO,
                        WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
    %(levelname)s       Text logging level for the message ("DEBUG", "INFO",
                        "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL")
    %(pathname)s        Full pathname of the source file where the logging
                        call was issued (if available)
    %(filename)s        Filename portion of pathname
    %(module)s          Module (name portion of filename)
    %(lineno)d          Source line number where the logging call was issued
                        (if available)
    %(funcName)s        Function name
    %(created)f         Time when the LogRecord was created (time.time()
                        return value)
    %(asctime)s         Textual time when the LogRecord was created
    %(msecs)d           Millisecond portion of the creation time
    %(relativeCreated)d Time in milliseconds when the LogRecord was created,
                        relative to the time the logging module was loaded
                        (typically at application startup time)
    %(thread)d          Thread ID (if available)
    %(threadName)s      Thread name (if available)
    %(process)d         Process ID (if available)
    %(message)s         The result of record.getMessage(), computed just as
                        the record is emitted
    %(hostname)         (Logprep specific) The hostname of the machine where
                        the log was emitted
