        """Main parsing function to parse rule into list of less complex rules.

        This function aims to parse a rule into a list of less complex rules that shows the same
        decision behavior when matching events.

        First, Not expressions are resolved by applying De Morgan's law on the rule's expression.
        Example: `not((A and not B) or not C)` becomes `(not A or B) and C`.

        Then the expression is transformed into a list representing the disjunctive normal form
        (DNF). This representation is required to build the rule tree.
        Example: `(not A or B) and C` becomes `[[not A, C], [B, C]]`,
        which is equivalent to the DNF `(not A and C) or (B and C)`.

        The segments are then sorted using a priority dict to achieve a better performance for
        rule matching.

        Afterwards, Exists filter expressions are added for every segment that is not an
        Exists, Not or Always expression.
        Those are then being checked first in the tree.
        Exists expressions are cheap and can lead to an optimization of the rule matching.

        Finally, tags may be added to more efficiently check the existence of configured fields.
        This is configured via a tag map, by specifying target fields and tags.
        Those tags are added as Exists filters in front of the rule to be checked first if the
        target field exists.
        Example: The tag map `{"some.key": "some_tag"}` would add an Exists filter
        `Exists("some_tag")` in front of the rules with filters `some.key: foo OR key_x` and
        `key_y AND some.key: bar`, but not the rule with filter `key_z: foo`, since it does not
        have the field `some.key`


        Parameters
        ----------
        rule: Rule
            Rule to be parsed.
        priority_dict: dict
            Dictionary containing priority values for field names that are used to sort filter
            expression in a rule.

        Returns
        -------
        list
            List of parsed rules. Each parsed rule is a list of filter expressions itself.
            The first list represents a disjunction and the sub-lists represent conjunctions,
            like in the disjunctive normal form.

        Raises
        ------
        RuleParserException
            Throws RuleParserException when parser encounters a problem during the parsing process.
