    The segmenter gets a (compound) FilterExpression as input,
    which must have been already resolved via De Morgan's law.
    That means all NOT-expressions must have been resolved.
    The expression is then changed into the disjunctive normal form (DNF),
    which is required for the rule tree.
    However, the output is not another FilterExpression, but a list of lists with rule segments
    (FilterExpressions that are not compound), which represent the FilterExpression in DNF.
    The outer list representing OR and the inner lists representing AND.

    This representation then allows to easily sort the rule segments,
    add tags and build a tree out of them.

    Example:
    Assume the following CompoundFilterExpression X as input:

    `X := (A and (B or C)) or D`

    Furthermore, assume that A, B and C are StringFilterExpressions.

    Calling segment_into_dnf(X) would result in the list `[[A, B], [A, C], [D]]`.
    This is equivalent to the FilterExpression `(A and B) or (A and C) or (D)`,
    which is the DNF of X.
