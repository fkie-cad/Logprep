## Next Release

### Features
### Improvements
### Bugfixes
### Breaking

## v3.0.0

### Features

* Add ability to add fields from SQL database via GenericAdder
* Prometheus Exporter now exports also processor specific metrics
* Add `--version` cli argument to print the current logprep version, as well as the configuration
version if found

### Improvements

* Automatically release logprep on pypi
* Configure abstract dependencies for pypi releases
* Refactor domain resolver
* Refactor `processor_stats` to `metrics`. Metrics are now collected in separate dataclasses

### Bugfixes

* Fix processor initialization in auto rule tester
* Fix generation of RST-Docs

### Breaking 

* Metrics refactoring: 
  * The json output format of the previously known status_logger has changed
  * The configuration key word is now `metrics` instead of `status_logger`
  * The configuration for the time measurement is now part of the metrics configuration
  * The metrics tracking still includes values about how many warnings and errors happened, but 
  not of what type. For that the regular logprep logging should be consolidated.

## v2.0.1
