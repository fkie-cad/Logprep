representation is not present anymore in the predetector output, the name `rule_filter` will stay
in place of the `lucene_filter` name.

## v6.4.0
### Improvements

* Bump `requests` to `>=2.31.0` to circumvent `CVE-2023-32681`
* Include a lucene representation of the rule filter into the predetector results. The
representation is not completely lucene compatible due to non-existing regex functionality.

* Fix error handling of FieldManager if no mapped source field exists in the event.
* Fix Grokker such that only the first grok pattern match is applied instead of all matching
pattern

grok-pattern compatibility with the normalizer and other grok tools

## v6.3.0
### Features

* Extend dissector such that it can trim characters around dissected field with `%{field-( )}`
notation.
* Extend timestamper such that it can take multiple source_formats. First format that matches
will be used, all following formats will be ignored

### Bugfix

* Fix resetting processor caches in the `auto_rule_corpus_tester` by initializing all processors
between test cases.
* Fix processing of generic rules after there was an error inside the specific rules.

### Bugfixes

* Fix resetting of some metric, e.g. `number_of_matches`.

### Breaking

## v3.3.0

### Features

* Normalizer can now write grok failure fields to an event when no grok pattern matches and if
`failure_target_field` is specified in the configuration

### Bugfixes

* Fix config validation of the preprocessor `version_info_target_field`.

## v3.2.0

### Features

* Add feature to automatically add version information to all events, configured via the
`connector > consumer > preprocessing` configuration
* Expose logprep and config version in metric targets
* Dry-Run accepts now a single json without brackets for input type `json`

### Improvements

* Move the config hmac options to the new subkey `preprocessing`, maintain backward compatibility,
but mark old version as deprecated.
* Make the generic adder write the SQL table to a file and load it from there instead of loading it
from the database for every process of the multiprocessing pipeline.
Furthermore, only connect to the SQL database on checking if the database table has changed and the
file is stale.
This reduces the SQL connections.
Before, there was permanently one connection per multiprocessing pipeline active and now there is
only one connection per Logprep instance active when accessing the database.

### Bugfixes

* Fix SelectiveExtractor output. The internal extracted list wasn't cleared between each event,
leading to duplication in the output of the processor. Now the events are cleared such that only
the result of the current event is returned.

## v3.1.0

### Features

* Add metric for mean processing time per event for the full pipeline, in addition to per processor

### Bugfixes

* Fix performance of the metrics tracking. Due to a store metrics statement at the wrong position
the logprep performance was dramatically decreased when tracking metrics was activated.

## v3.0.0

* Add ability to add fields from SQL database via GenericAdder
* Prometheus Exporter now exports also processor specific metrics

### Breaking

* Metrics refactoring:
  * The json output format of the previously known status_logger has changed
  * The configuration key word is now `metrics` instead of `status_logger`
  * The configuration for the time measurement is now part of the metrics configuration
  * The metrics tracking still includes values about how many warnings and errors happened, but
  not of what type. For that the regular logprep logging should be consolidated.
